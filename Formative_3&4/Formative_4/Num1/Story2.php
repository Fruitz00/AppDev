    <h1> Through the eyes of a Dragon </h1>
<p>
    Rex Lapis was walking alone in the mountains,<br>
    He heard a remote voice unlike any other<br>
    coming form a crack in the earth.<br>
    "Most of the ancient Geo life forms that live below Liyue are blind,<br>
    having not seen the sunlight for an age."<br>
    The voice was sometimes sad and songlike, other times it was loud and thunderous.<br>
    The Lord of Geo searched here and there<br>
    before finally unearthing a strange stone from the bedrock.<br>
    "Thats how Azhdaha was."<br>
    "I answered his wish, and took him above ground."<br>
    The Lord of Geo took pity on the rock's spirit<br>
    and carved it into a magnificent work of craftsmanship,<br>
    a vivid representation of a dragon.<br>
    "I bestowed him with a pair of eyes to see the world,<br>
    and came to an agreement with him."
    
    With his fingers, he made two eyes, <br>
    Quicker than words could tell, lightning flashed,<br>
    and thunder roared, and a living, breathing dragon soared<br>
    through the clouds!<br>

    "I agreed to let him live among the people above ground,<br>
    but if the day ever came when he brought ruin to order, <br>
    he would once again be sealed in the dark."<br>

    The dragon accompanied the Lord of Geo, fighting campaigns alongside him<br>
    in the four corners of the world.<br>
    We have a saying to eulogize these events.<br>
    The crash of the spear leave billowing dust,<br>
    the mountains and waters made way at the sound.<br>
    The sight of a dragon bestowed with a touch,<br>
    The promise of rainwater blessing the ground<br>
