    <h1> Lady Ningguang and her Jade Chamber</h1>
<p>
    They say when Lady Ningguang ponders important affairs,
    she retreats to her Jade Chamber with none but her three 
    closest confidantes in tow. Why bring she these trusted three?
    To sift through sources, dig through documents, looking for information.
    Piece by piece, facts and figures, Paint a picture on the walls of the chamber. 
    But before the wall is filled, Lady Ningguang's miond is made up.
    Having made her call, She has every document shredded, and fwoosh!
    She scatters the shavings out her window.
    Ah look at them, how they billow in the wind like a sidden swirling blizzard.
    As the fragments fall, traces of text flicker before the eyes 
    of the merchants of Liyue like ink stains in white snow.
    The saying goes, the rarest treasures in te land are the words
    brought by the paper snow. For the words on the Tianquan have 
    the power to move mountains and all throughout the land know it.
