    <h1> The Lonely Qilin </h1>
<p>
    Most benevolent amont all adepti are the Qilin. 
    They drink only spring water and eat only whole grain.
    But perhaps the mountainous dwellings of all adepti in Jueyun Karst
    might be too lonely for her human side.
    Under moonlight did one see her last, She stood by the 
    precipice edge, and upon the mist veiled mountains she gazed
    Her thin figure was immersed in the vast sea of clouds.
    One noticed her loneliness and sought to convince her to go back to the human world.
    But just then, she said thus: "Liyue harbor feels even lonelier than Jueyun karst"
    "When i took at the sea of clouds in Jueyun Karst,
    I merely feel the loneliness of a solitary could gazer.
    When i step into the sea of people in Liyue, I feel the
    loneliness of an inhuman that doesnt belong in the human world."
